ITL313-18 (SIA 2 LAB)
Final Term Lab Activities and Mini Project
Project Overview
This project would involve several key components, each using Python libraries:
1. GUI (Graphical User Interface)
Tkinter
PyQt/PySide
2. Login System (user authentication)
a. SQLite for User Data Storage: A small database used for storing usernames and hashed
passwords.
b. Password Hashing: Python's built-in hashlib to securely hash and salt passwords before
storing them. Never store plain-text passwords.
c. Logic: The GUI would have input fields for the username and password. On login, the
script would check the entered username against the database and verify the password
using the stored hash.
